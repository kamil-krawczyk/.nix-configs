# :snowflake: Nix-based Host Configurations

This repository contains the configuration files for my hosts, managed using the
Nix package manager.

## What is Nix?

Nix is a purely functional package manager that allows for reproducible and
declarative system configurations. It offers several advantages over traditional
package managers, including:

* **Reproducibility:** Nix ensures that every package and its dependencies are
built from the same source code, guaranteeing that the same configuration will
always produce the same result.
* **Declarative Configuration:** Nix allows you to define your entire system
configuration in a declarative way, specifying what you want your system to look
like rather than how to achieve it.
* **Rollbacks:** Nix makes it easy to roll back to previous system
configurations if something goes wrong.
* **Multi-user Support:** Nix allows multiple users to have their own isolated
environments, each with its own set of packages and configurations.

## What is NixOS?

NixOS is a Linux distribution built on top of the Nix package manager. It takes
the principles of Nix to the extreme, treating the entire operating system as
a package. This means that everything from the kernel to the system services
is managed by Nix, providing a level of reproducibility and control that is
unmatched by other Linux distributions.

## What is Nix-Darwin?

Nix-Darwin is a tool that brings the benefits of Nix to macOS. It allows you to
manage your macOS system configuration in a declarative way, just like NixOS.

## What is Home Manager?

Home Manager is a tool that allows you to manage your user environment
using Nix. It can be used to manage your dotfiles, applications, and other
user-specific settings.

# :eyes: Remarks on the project

This project is open and serves as an example of how to create configurations
using Nix. However, I advise against trying to use it directly. If you want
to use this project as a base, follow these steps:

1. Copy the project to a new repository.
2. Remove or modify the code that uses the secrets.
3. For **nix-darwin** configurations, remove the entries related to installing
applications from the Apple Store (`homebrew.masApps`). This configuration snippet
is likely to work only if the user is logged into an Apple account that has
purchased all the applications listed in `homebrew.masApps`.

# :pencil: :apple: Notes on Darwin hosts

I install the Nix package manager on Darwin systems using the graphical
[Determinate Nix Installer](https://docs.determinate.systems). According to
the note on the nix-darwin project page, since Determinate manages the Nix
installation itself, Nix management should be disabled in the nix-darwin
configuration:

    nix.enable = false;

Please remember to take care of periodic Nix updates in this case:

    sudo -i nix upgrade-nix

After installing Nix and downloading the repository with configuration, the
first system rebuild should be done using the following command:

    nix run nix-darwin/master#darwin-rebuild -- switch --flake .#<configuration>

Further system rebuilds can be performed directly using the `darwin-rebuild`
command:

    darwin-rebuild switch --flake .#<configuration>

# :pray: Acknowledgements

The following projects and their creators strongly inspired me while I was
learning Nix and building my own configurations.
